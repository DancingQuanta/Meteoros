Meteoros
========

This project is based on [AirPi](https://github.com/tomhartley/AirPi) and
[terminal, simple serial terminal in Python](https://github.com/Hodapp87/terminal)

AirPi is a Raspberry Pi weather station and air quality monitor. I used some
code from `terminal` to make it easier to monitor multiple serial devices
concurrently.

I created this project for NERC Research Experience Placement at School of Earth
and Environment, University of Leeds in 2016.
